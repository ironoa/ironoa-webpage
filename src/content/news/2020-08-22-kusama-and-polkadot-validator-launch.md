title: Kusama and Polkadot Validators Launch

Our Kusama and Polkadot validators began operations in 2020. The validators initially participated in the 1KV program, which provided nomination support to community validators.

Following the shutdown of the 1KV program, our Kusama validator now operates fully independently, relying on direct nominations from the community.
