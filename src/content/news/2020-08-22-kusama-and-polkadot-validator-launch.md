Our Kusama and Polkadot validators began operations in 2020. The validators initially participated in the [1KV Program](https://polkadot.com/blog/supporting-decentralization-join-the-polkadot-thousand-validators-programme/), which provided nomination support to community validators.

Following the shutdown of the 1KV Program, our Kusama validator now operates fully independently, relying on direct nominations from the community.
