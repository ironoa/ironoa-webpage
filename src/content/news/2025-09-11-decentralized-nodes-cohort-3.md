Our Polkadot validator has been selected for the third cohort of the Web3 Foundation's [Decentralized Nodes](https://nodes.web3.foundation) Program. The program provides nomination support to validators that meet specific operational and infrastructure standards.

This selection applies to our Polkadot validator. Our Kusama validator operates independently.
